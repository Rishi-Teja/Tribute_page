                  <p>
                    Virat Kohli , born 5 November 1988 is an Indian international cricketer who plays Test and
                    ODI cricket for the Indian national team. A former captain in all formats of the game,
                    Kohli retired from the T20I format following India's win at the 2024 T20 World Cup. He's a
                    right-handed batsman and an occasional unorthodox right arm quick bowler. Kohli holds the
                    highest IPL run-scorer record, ranks third in T20I, third in ODI, and stands the
                    fourth-highest in international cricket. Regarded as one of the greatest batsmen of all time,
                    he also holds the record for scoring the most centuries in ODI cricket and is second in the list
                    of most international centuries scored in international cricket.

                    In August 2008, Kohli was included in the ODl squad for the tour of Sri Lanka
                    and the Champions Trophy in Pakistan. Prior to the Sri Lankan tour, Kohli had limited
                    experience, with only eight List A matches under his belt.[20] So, his selection was
                    considered a "surprise call-up".In November 2008, Kohli was selected for inclusion
                    in the squad for the home ODI series against England. However, he was not given an
                    opportunity to play in any of the matches.[28] In December 2008, Kohli was awarded
                    a Grade D contract by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) as part of the annual
                    contract list for the Indian national team which entitled him to receive ₹1.5 million (equivalent to ₹4.2 million or US$49,000 in 2023).
